Contains Python code for Studying and Predicting Insomnia Levels in Indian College Students using an Artificial Neural Network



Insomnia is a widely prevalent sleep disorder that has an adverse effect on the lifestyle of millions across the world. This paper proposes a novel probabilistic approach to identify insomnia. The proposed technique makes use of the positive predictive values of the Insomnia Severity Index and Athens Insomnia Scale to provide a stochastic measure of the existence of insomnia in a college student. A machine learning model for prediction of these levels on the basis of the Depression, Anxiety and Stress levels and their Social Adjustment level has been developed. The dataset was created with 158 samples collected from students by conducting online surveys based on standardizes tests. A neural network model was developed to predict the probability of insomnia. The results predicted by the neural network were compared with their actual values, giving a RMSE value of 0.13, which is deemed viable. The important contributions of this paper are creation of a new dataset, analysis and a probabilistic modelling of insomnia scores which should provide a significant improvement to the current class- based approach of classification.
